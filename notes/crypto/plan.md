   - Prime factorization
   - How primes form the basis for finite fields in cryptography

2. **Modular Arithmetic**

   - Modular addition, multiplication, and exponentiation
   - Inverses modulo _p_ (why they exist when _p_ is prime)

3. **Groups, Rings, Fields**
   - Difference between these structures
   - How "finite fields" (e.g., GF(p)) are used in elliptic curves

### Key Questions

1. **Why do we rely so heavily on prime numbers in cryptography?**
2. **What makes a field (especially a finite field) so crucial for defining the arithmetic on elliptic curves?**

Elliptic curves provide a group structure that is used to define public-key operations like ECDSA and BLS.

### Topics

1. **Basic Definition of an Elliptic Curve**

   - General form (Weierstrass equation): \( y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \) (over a field)

2. **Group Law on the Curve**

   - Point addition and point doubling
   - The "point at infinity" (identity element)
   - How to visualize the chord-and-tangent rule for adding points

3. **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**

   - Why it’s hard (and thus secure) to find \( k \) given \( kG \)

4. **Fields Over Which Curves Are Defined**
   - Prime fields (e.g., secp256k1 over \(\mathbf{F}\_p\))
   - Binary fields (less common today)
   - How the choice of field affects performance/security

### Key Questions

1. **How does the chord-and-tangent process define the group operation on elliptic curves?**
2. **Why do we define elliptic curves over prime fields rather than other field types?**
3. **What is it about the ECDLP that makes it computationally infeasible to solve at large key sizes?**

   - Commitment schemes (e.g., how a hash can be used for "commit-and-reveal")

4. **Performance & Hardware**
   - Why certain hashes are chosen for GPU or ASIC optimization
   - Tradeoffs between throughput and security margin

### Key Questions

1. **What is the difference between collision resistance and second preimage resistance?**

Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is commonly used for signatures (ECDSA, EdDSA, BLS) and secure key exchanges (ECDH).

### Topics
